##Question
Improvement of bouncing ball exercise.

##Description
Added multi-threaded support to the bouncing ball exercise from the previous homework. Each ball is now governed by a single thread which can be controlled via a slider. The total kinetic energy of the system for a fixed number of balls is always preserved, which showed above the slider. During addition of new balls, both their initial position, initial velocity, mass/radius and color can be chosen randomly from within a range.
