##Question
TCP/IP Socket programming

Create a simple TCP/IP chat application via Socket programming in Java. 

##Description
+ The chat application is capable of connecting to another instance running elsewhere on the same network, either as a host(accepts connections) or as a guest (requests connection from a known host and the port number of the host application).
+ The text messages appear in the text area and the user chat messages can be typed in a text field box in the window as shown in the screen shot below.
+ If hosting the chat, the IP address is automatically shown, but the port number can be set. If joining the chat, both the IP address and port number of the host application can be entered.
